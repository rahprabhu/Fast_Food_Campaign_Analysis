## About
A fast-food chain is planning to add a new item to the menu, but before fully rolling out the item, the company wants to experiment with three different campaigns promoting the new item at restaurants in randomly selected markets. The idea is to see which promotion works best at bringing in sales, which is reported on a weekly basis over a 4 week period.

## Hypothesis

With three different promotions being tested, the goal is to measure the sales behind each promotion and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in sales between the three promotions. That being said, the null and alternate hypothesis are as follows:

**Null**: There is **no** statistically significant difference in sales between the the three promotions.

**Alternate**: There is a statistically significant difference in sales between the three promotions.
